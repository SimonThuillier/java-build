# java-build tools
Welcome to this learning project for mastering jvm languages/maven/gradle/groovy build tools.
I'm not an expert myself, but I'm trying to learn and share it. Please star it if you find it useful !

# requirements
- you should have a jdk installed. This project has been tested with openjdk 17.0.1 on ubuntu 22.04.
- I'm using intellij as an IDE. It's not mandatory, but it helps. iml files are useful only when using it.
